# Is "Test Notification" Important for THIS App?

**YES, absolutely.**

For a Rental Marketplace, notifications are not just "nice to have"—they are **critical** for the business to function. Here is why this specific "Test" button is important for your users:

## 1. Money is at Stake (Time = Money)
In the rental business, every minute counts.
*   **Owners**: If they miss a "New Rental Request" notification, they lose a customer. The request might expire.
*   **Renters**: If they miss a "Return Due Soon" notification, they might get charged **Late Fees**.

## 2. Trust and Anxiety
New users often worry: *"Will I actually know when someone wants my item?"*
*   The **Test Notification** button gives them immediate **peace of mind**.
*   It proves to them: "Yes, this app can talk to me. I won't miss out."

## 3. Disputing "I Didn't Know"
*   If a user complains, *"I didn't return the car because I didn't get the reminder,"* support can ask them to press this button.
*   If it works, the issue was likely that they ignored the real alert.
*   It serves as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between **App Failure** and **User Error**.

## Summary
In a social media app, missing a "Like" is fine.
In a **Rental App**, missing a notification means **lost income** or **unexpected reliable fines**.
This small button is the tool that assures users they are connected.
